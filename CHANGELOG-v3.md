## Changed
- The Edit Order page is now a Vue app. This is likely to break any plugins that use JavaScript to modify the DOM on that page.
- Order status change emails are triggered by a job on the queue for faster checkout.
- If no `donationAmount` line item option parameter is submitted when adding a donation to the cart, the donation amount will default to zero.
- Controller actions now call `craft\commerce\elements\Order::toArray()` when generating the cart array for JSON responses.
- `commerce/payments/pay` JSON responses now list payment form errors under `paymentFormErrors` rather than `paymentForm`.
- Customer records that are anonymous and orphaned are now deleted during garbage collection.
- Changed the default category relationship type on promotions from `sourceElement` to `element` .
- `purgeInactiveCartsDuration` default value is number of seconds as an integer and is now being passed through `craft\cms\helpers\ConfigHelper::durationInSeconds()`.
- `activeCartDuration` default value is number of seconds as an integer and is now being passed through `craft\cms\helpers\ConfigHelper::durationInSeconds()`.
- `craft\commerce\controllers\CustomerAddressesController::actionSave()` no long forces primary shipping and billing addresses if they do not exist.
- Moved `craft\commerce\services\States::getAllStatesAsList` logic to `craft\commerce\services\States::getAllStatesAsListGroupedByCountryId` to be consistent with other service methods. 
- `allowEmptyCartOnCheckout` default value is false.
- `totalDiscountUses` now counts all usage instances of a discount.
- Discount uses for `perUserLimit` and `perEmailLimit` are now counted on every discount use instead of only when a coupon code is used.
- Addresses no longer require a first and last name.
- Clearing discount usage counters is now done on a per counter basis.
